      <h3>What is Unpatch?</h3>
      <p>
        Unpatch is a guide that explains how to use SH1mmer even after it has
        been <i>completely</i> patched. It was found by a user on Discord named
        <a href="https://discord.com/users/476169716998733834">@olyb</a>
        and was released on April 26th, 2023.

      <h4>
        If this isn't working for you, use:
        <a href="https://fog.gay">E-Halcyon</a>
        instead.

        <u onclick="alert(messages.chromebook); ">A Chromebook</u>; it has to be

      <h3>Disabling WP</h3>
      <p>
        First, you'll need to unplug everything in the Chromebook, such as the
        charger, any USB devices, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        Take your <u onclick="alert(messages.screw);">screwdriver</u> and open
        the back panel of your Chromebook.
      </p>
      <p>
        Find the battery cable and unplug it from the Chromebook, this should
        disable the Write Protection on the majority of supported Chromebooks w/
        SH1mmer.
      </p>
      <p>An <b>example</b> of the battery connector location is shown below:</p>
        <img src="/sh1mmer/assets/unpatch_battery.png" />
        <img src="/sh1mmer/assets/unpatch_battery_connector.png" />
      <br />
      <i> The Chromebook shown here is the Acer Chromebook 311 (C733).</i>
      <p>
        Plug in the charger, and turn on the Chromebook. Yes, this will work as
        the Chromebook will run from the power of the charger.
      </p>
      <p>
        On some Chromebooks such as <kbd>DEDEDE</kbd>, you will need to jump
        two pins to disable WP. You can easily do this by taking out the 
        motherboard and using a paperclip to jump the two.
      </p>
        <i>
          This is the case for you if WP doesn't disable after unplugging the battery.
        </i>

        <img src="/sh1mmer/assets/unpatch_jumper_pins.png" />
      <br />
        <i>
          The Chromebook shown here is the Acer Chromebook Spin 511 (R753T).
        </i>
      <p>
        If the Chromebook fails to boot from the charger because it bootloops at
        the developer mode screen, hold <kbd>Power (⏻) + Reload (↻) + ESC</kbd>
        till you're at the recovery screen to continue to the next step.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h3>Using SH1mmer</h3>
      <p>
        Enable developer mode and boot into SH1mmer using your external drive
        (USB, SD, etc) then use "Un-Enroll / Deprovision". This
        <b>WILL ERROR</b> but we'll ignore that for now.
      </p>
      <i>
        If you're using an old & legacy version, you'll need to run
        <kbd>Disable block_devmode</kbd> alongside everything else.
      </i>
      <p>
        Go into the Bash Shell by using "Open Bash". In the Bash Shell, execute
        the following command below: <br />
        <kbd>/usr/share/vboot/bin/set_gbb_flags.sh 0x8090</kbd>
      </p>
      <i> This lets you enter ChromeOS in dev mode, which is required later.</i>
      <p>The command should report "success" at the end like this image:</p>
      <img src="/sh1mmer/assets/unpatch_bash_results.png" />
      <br />
      <i>
        If it fails, you've been on <kbd>v114</kbd> or newer before and cannot
        disable WP until you're un-enrolled, somehow.
      </i>
      <p>
        After using this command, <b>DO NOT USE "Reset GBB Flags"</b>, as you'll
        fuck things up if you do so.
      </p>
      <p>
        Exit SH1mmer and turn off your Chromebook. Unplug everything including
        the charger, reconnect the battery, and then reconnect the charger.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h3>ChromeOS Commands</h3>
      <p>
        Boot up your Chromebook and press <kbd>CTRL + D</kbd> to enter ChromeOS
        in a developer mode state.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once it completes and boots into ChromeOS, press
        <kbd>CTRL + ALT + SHIFT + R</kbd> to powerwash the Chromebook.
      </p>
      <p>
        After powerwashing, immediately go into the ChromeOS shell by pressing
        <kbd>CTRL + ALT + F2 (→)</kbd>. The shell should look like the image
        below:
      </p>
      <img src="/sh1mmer/assets/unpatch_shell.png" />
      <p>
        Log into the user as: <kbd>root</kbd>, then run the following commands:
        <br />
        <kbd>tpm_manager_client take_ownership</kbd>
        <br />
        <kbd>cryptohome --action=remove_firmware_management_parameters</kbd>
      </p>
      <p>The screen should report "success" like the image below:</p>
      <img src="/sh1mmer/assets/unpatch_shell_results.png" />
      <br />
      <i>
        If it fails, try downgrading to <kbd>v110</kbd> if possible. If you
        can't, use E-Halycon instead.
      </i>
      <p>
        Press <kbd>CTRL + ALT + F1 (←)</kbd> to exit out of the shell, then
        press <kbd>CTRL + ALT + Shift + R</kbd> to powerwash the Chromebook
        again.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h3>Aftermath</h3>
      <p>
        After powerwashing the Chromebook again and going through the setup, the
        Chromebook <i>should</i> no longer re-enroll and you may use it as a
        normal laptop.
      </p>
      <p>
        You will only ever have to do this once, and this will let you use
        SH1mmer even after it has been <b>completely patched.</b>
