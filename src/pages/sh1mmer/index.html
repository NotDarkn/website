      <h3>What is SH1mmer?</h3>
      <p>
        SH1mmer is an exploit capable of completely unenrolling
        enterprise-managed Chromebooks. It was found by the
        <a href="https://mercurywork.shop">Mercury Workshop team</a> and was
        released on January 13th, 2023. For more info, check out the
        <a href="https://coolelectronics.me/blog/breaking-cros-2">Writeup</a> by
        CoolElectronics.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>
        If this isn't working for you, check
        <button id="fogbutton" style="cursor: pointer">"The Fog"</button>
        section below.
      </h4>
    </div>
    <div class="section green">
      <h3>What you will need</h3>
      <li>A USB with at least 8 GBs of storage</li>
      <li>
        <u onclick="alert(messages.pc); ">A personal computer or Chromebook;</u>
        note that you need admin perms on Windows/MacOS
      </li>
      <hr />
      <h3>Writing to USB</h3>
      <p>
        First, you'll need to find your managed Chromebook's board name. This
        can be done by going to <kbd>chrome://version</kbd> on your Chromebook
        and copying the word after <kbd>stable-channel</kbd>, or with
        <u onclick="alert(messages.board); ">a variety of other methods</u>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If your board name is in the list below, your board has a publicly
        leaked RMA shim. If it's not, you'll have to source it on your own...
        somehow.
      </p>
      brask, brya, clapper, coral, corsola, dedede, enguarde, glimmer, grunt,
      hana, hatch, jacuzzi, kukui, lulu, nami, octopus, orco, pyro, reks,
      sentry, stout, strongbad, tidus, ultima, volteer, zork
      <p>
        First you need to download a SH1mmer bin at
        <a href="https://dl.osu.bio">dl.osu.bio</a><br />
        Then build an injected shim using your bin at the
        <a href="/sh1mmer/builder" target="_self">SH1mmer Web Builder</a><br />
        Once you've obtained a INJECTED SHIM (NOT A RAW SHIM), you can continue.
      </p>
      <p>
        Download the
        <a
          href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pocpnlppkickgojjlmhdmidojbmbodfm"
        >
          Chromebook Recovery Utility</a
        >
        extension on your personal computer as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once the downloads are complete,
        <u onclick="alert(messages.launch);">launch the recovery utility</u>
        and plug your USB into your personal computer.
      </p>
      <i>Note: Your USB will be completely cleared and partitioned.</i>
      <p>
        In the recovery utility window, click the settings icon (⚙) and press
        "Use local image".
      </p>
      <img src="/sh1mmer/assets/recovery_utility.png" />
      <p>
        Select your injected shim file, identify your USB, and start the writing
        process. This will take about 10 minutes.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h3>Executing on Chromebook</h3>
      <p>
        Once writing is complete, enter recovery mode on your Chromebook. This
        is done by pressing the power button (⏻), reload key (↻), and ESC key at
        the same time. Your screen should look one of the images below:
      </p>
      <img src="/sh1mmer/assets/recover_black.png" />
      <img src="/sh1mmer/assets/recover_white.png" />
      <p>Press <kbd>CTRL + D</kbd> on this screen, then press enter.</p>
      <p>
        It will now say something about "Confirm returning to secure mode" or
        that "OS verification is OFF". You will most likely not actually be in
        dev mode, but the exploit will work regardless. Your screen should look
        like one of the images below:
      </p>
      <img src="/sh1mmer/assets/confirm_black.png" />
      <img src="/sh1mmer/assets/confirm_white.png" />
      <p>
        On this screen, press the power button (⏻), reload key (↻), and ESC key
        at the same time again! This is very important and cannot be skipped.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once it re-shows the original recovery screen, plug your shimmed USB
        into your Chromebook, and press the power button (⏻), reload key (↻),
        and ESC key again. After a brief black-and-white loading screen, you
        should be in the SH1mmer menu.
      </p>
      <img src="/sh1mmer/assets/utils-select01.png" />
      <p>Play around with the UI, exit, and reboot.</p>
      <hr />
      <h3>What now?</h3>
      <p>
        You will now be able to, among other things, unenroll your Chromebook.
        It will now behave entirely as if it is a personal computer and no
        longer contain spyware or blocker extensions. After you do this and get
        past the "Determining Device Configuration" screen, you will be able to
        actually turn dev mode on.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that while unenrolled, it is recommended to add your personal
        account first, then add your school account, then switch between the two
        as needed. Mercury Workshop does not condone the use of SH1mmer or
        unenrolling to cheat in school.
      </p>
      <p>
        The biggest challenges with unenrolling are connecting to the school
        network and taking state or national exams (since there are no kiosk
        apps anymore).
      </p>
      <p>
        There are many methods to get a school Wi-Fi password while enrolled,
        including
        <a href="https://luphoria.com/netlog-policy-password-tool"
          >the policy netlog trick</a
        >. While on a school account and unenrolled, you can bypass Wi-Fi blocks
        by using a secure DNS such as Cloudflare 1.1.1.1 from
        <kbd>chrome://os-settings/osPrivacy</kbd>. It is also recommended to
        enable "MAC address randomization" in <kbd>chrome://flags</kbd> to stay
        hidden.
      </p>
      <img src="/sh1mmer/assets/secure_dns.png" />
      <img src="/sh1mmer/assets/mac_randomization.png" />
      <p>
        To take a kiosk exam, the safest option is to re-enroll temporarily.
        Instructions for doing that are hosted at this guide:
        <a href="/sh1mmer/kiosk" target="_self">Kiosk</a> or alternatively, the original text file (to use if you need a local copy of it) <a href="/sh1mmer/kiosk.txt" target="_self">Kiosk.txt</a> (no images, btw)

        <h3>The Fog...</h3>
        <h4>(Google's response, and why this might not be working for you)</h4>
        <p>
          Downgrading and unenrollment has been patched by Google. If your
          Chromebook has never updated to version 112 before (check in
          <kbd>chrome://version</kbd>), then you can ignore this and follow the
          normal instructions. If not, unenrollment will not work as normal.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you aren't willing to take apart your Chromebook to unenroll, you
          can use an affiliated project,
          <a href="https://fog.gay">E-HALCYON</a>, to boot into a deprovisioned
          environment temporarily.
