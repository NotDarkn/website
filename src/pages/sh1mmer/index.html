    <h3>What is SH1mmer?</h3>
    <p>
      SH1mmer is an exploit capable of completely unenrolling
      enterprise-managed Chromebooks. It was found by
      the <a href="https://mercurywork.shop">Mercury Workshop team</a> and
      was released on January 13th, 2023.

      For more info, check out the <a href="https://coolelectronics.me/blog/breaking-cros-2">Writeup</a> by CoolElectronics.
    </p>
      <br>
    <h4>If this isn't working for you, check <a href="#The%20Fog...">"The Fog"</a> section below.</h4>

  </div>
  <div class="section green">
    <h3>What you will need</h3>
    <li>A USB with at least 8 GBs of storage</li>
    <li>
      <u onclick="alert(messages.pc)">A personal computer or Chromebook;</u> note that you
      need admin perms on Windows/MacOS
    </li>
    <hr />
    <h3>Writing to USB</h3>
    <p>
      First, you'll need to find your managed Chromebook's board name. This can
      be done by going to <kbd>chrome://version</kbd> on your Chromebook and
      copying the word after <kbd>stable-channel</kbd>, or with
      <u onclick="alert(messages.board)">a variety of other methods</u>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If your board name is in the list below, your board has a publicly leaked RMA shim. If it's not, you'll have to
      source it
      on your own... somehow.
    </p>
    brask, brya, clapper, coral, corsola, dedede, enguarde, glimmer, grunt, hana,
    hatch, jacuzzi, kukui, lulu, nami, octopus, orco, pyro, reks, sentry, stout,
    strongbad, tidus, ultima, volteer, zork
    <p>
      First you need to download a SH1mmer bin at <a
        href="https://dl.osu.bio">dl.osu.bio</a><br>
        Then build an injected shim using your bin at the <a
        href="/sh1mmer/builder">SH1mmer Web Builder</a><br>
      Once you've obtained a INJECTED SHIM (NOT A RAW SHIM), you can continue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Download the <a 
      href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pocpnlppkickgojjlmhdmidojbmbodfm">
        Chromebook Recovery Utility</a> extension on your personal computer as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once the downloads are complete,
      <u onclick="alert(messages.launch)">launch the recovery utility</u>
      and plug your USB into your personal computer. 
    </p>
      <i>Note: Your USB will be completely cleared and partitioned.</i>
    <p>
      In the recovery utility window, click the settings icon (⚙) and press "Use
      local image".
    </p>
    <img src="/sh1mmer/assets/recovery_utility.png" />
    <p>
      Select your injected shim file, identify your USB, and start the writing process.
      This will take about 10 minutes.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h3>Executing on Chromebook</h3>
    <p>
      Once writing is complete, enter recovery mode on your Chromebook. This
      is done by pressing the power button, reload key (↻), and ESC key at the
      same time. Your screen should look one of the images below:
    </p>
    <img src="/sh1mmer/assets/recover_black.png" />
    <img src="/sh1mmer/assets/recover_white.png" />
    <p>Press <kbd>CTRL + D</kbd> on this screen, then press enter.</p>
    <p>
      It will now say something about "Confirm returning to secure mode" or that "OS
      verification is OFF". You will most likely not actually be in dev mode,
      but the exploit will work regardless. Your screen should look like one
      of the images below:
    </p>
    <img src="/sh1mmer/assets/confirm_black.png" />
    <img src="/sh1mmer/assets/confirm_white.png" />
    <p>
      On this screen, press the power button, reload key (↻), and ESC key at
      the same time again! This is very important and cannot be skipped.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once it re-shows the original recovery screen, plug your shimmed USB
      into your Chromebook, and press the power button, reload key (↻), and
      ESC key again. After a brief black-and-white loading screen, you should
      be in the SH1mmer menu.
    </p>
    <img src="/sh1mmer/assets/utils-select01.png" />
    <p>Play around with the UI, exit, and reboot.</p>
    <hr />
      <h3>What now?</h3>
      <p>
        You will now be able to, among other things, unenroll your Chromebook.
        It will now behave entirely as if it is a personal computer and no
        longer contain spyware or blocker extensions. After you do this and get
        past the "Determining Device Configuration" screen, you will be able to
        actually turn dev mode on.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that while unenrolled, it is recommended to add your personal
        account first, then add your school account, then switch between the two
        as needed. Mercury Workshop does not condone the use of SH1mmer or
        unenrolling to cheat in school.
      </p>
      <p>
        The biggest challenges with unenrolling are connecting to the school
        network and taking state or national exams (since there are no kiosk
        apps anymore).
      </p>
      <p>
        There are many methods to get a school Wi-Fi password while enrolled,
        including
        <a href="https://luphoria.com/netlog-policy-password-tool">the policy netlog trick</a>. While on a school
        account
        and unenrolled, you can bypass Wi-Fi blocks
        by using a secure DNS such as Cloudflare 1.1.1.1 from
        <kbd>chrome://os-settings/osPrivacy</kbd>. It is also recommended to
        enable "MAC address randomization" in <kbd>chrome://flags</kbd> to stay
        hidden.
      </p>
      <img src="/sh1mmer/assets/secure_dns.png" />
      <img src="/sh1mmer/assets/mac_randomization.png" />
      <p>
        To take a kiosk exam, the safest option is to re-enroll temporarily.
        Instructions for doing that are hosted
        <a href="/sh1mmer/kiosks.txt">at this TXT file</a>. Saving a copy of this file
        for future reference is probably a smart move.
      </p>
    <hr />
      <h3> The Fog...</h3>
      <h4>(Google's response, and why this might not be working for you)</h4>
      <p>
        Downgrading and unenrollment has been patched by Google. If your Chromebook has never updated to version 112
        before (check in <kbd>chrome://version</kbd>), then you can ignore this and follow the normal instructions. If not,
        unenrollment will not work as normal.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you aren't willing to take apart your Chromebook to unenroll, you can use an affiliated project,
        <a href="https://fog.gay">E-HALCYON</a>, to boot into a deprovisioned environment temporarily.
