      <h3>Enabling Developer Mode</h3>
      <p>
        Press <kbd>Power (⏻) + Reload (↻) + ESC</kbd> at the same time to enter
        the recovery screen. It'll look like one of the images below:
      </p>
      <img src="/sh1mmer/assets/recover_black.png" />
      <img src="/sh1mmer/assets/recover_white.png" />
      <p>
        On this screen, press <kbd>CTRL + D</kbd> at the same time, then follow
        the on-screen instructions to enable developer mode.
      </p>
      <p>
        After around six minutes of loading developer mode, the screen should
        look like one of the images below:
      </p>
      <img src="/sh1mmer/assets/devmode_black.png" />
      <img src="/sh1mmer/assets/devmode_white.png" />
      <p>
        Press <kbd>CTRL + D</kbd> again on this screen to get past it, and you
        should now be loading into ChromeOS with developer mode!
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h3>Powerwashing</h3>
      <p>
        If you just enabled developer mode, your Chromebook should already be
        powerwashed, so you won't need to proceed with this step.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you already have developer mode enabled and have data, you will need
        to powerwash the Chromebook again.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sign out of your account, then press <kbd>CTRL + ALT + SHIFT + R</kbd>
        at the same time on the account selection screen. After that it should
        look like the image below:
      </p>
      <img src="/sh1mmer/assets/powerwash.png" />
      <p>
        From here, press "Powerwash" and proceed with the on-screen instructions
        and let it finish.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h3>Re-Enrollment</h3>
      <p>
        Go through the setup process and you should end up at this screen below:
      </p>
      <img src="/sh1mmer/assets/enrollment.png" />
      <p>
        Press the "Enterprise Enrollment" button and log in with your school
        account to re-enroll into the Chromebook.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <p style="text-align: center">
        <b>IMPORTANT:</b> DO NOT CLOSE YOUR CHROMEBOOK until the next step and
        DO NOT SKIP the next step
        <br />
        -- SERIOUSLY --
        <br />
        <b>IMPORTANT:</b> DO NOT CLOSE YOUR CHROMEBOOK until the next step and
        DO NOT SKIP the next step
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h3>Safe Re-Unenroll</h3>
      <p>
        By this point, you should be at the district login screen, which could
        look like the image shown below:
      </p>
      <img src="/sh1mmer/assets/district_login.png" />
      <p>
        On this screen, press <kbd>CTRL + ALT + F2 (→)</kbd>. After pressing
        this, you should end up on a black console-looking screen. It should
        look like the image below:
      </p>
      <img src="/sh1mmer/assets/chromeos_console.png" />
      <p>
        The login is <kbd>root</kbd>, and <b>if it needs a password</b>, the
        password is <kbd>test0000</kbd>. After logging in, some red text should
        appear meaning you can type commands into the console now.
      </p>
      <p>
        Type this command in the console and press Enter: <br />
        <kbd>sudo vpd -i RW_VPD -s check_enrollment=0</kbd>
      </p>
      <p>
        Your device should now be un-enrolled again, but you should still be
        inside of a currently enrolled session.
      </p>
      <p>
        Press <kbd>CTRL + ALT + F1 (←)</kbd> and you should exit out of the
        black console screen and re-enter the district login screen.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <h3>Using Kiosk</h3>
      <p>Take your Kiosk test normally as you would.</p>
      <p>
        Try not to close your Chromebook lid until you're
        <b>ACTUALLY IN THE KIOSK APP</b>, if you shut down your Chromebook in
        any way before that it'll force you to powerwash/turn on dev mode again
        and will be majorly inconvenient.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you are done with the kiosk test, reboot your computer with
        <kbd>Power (⏻) + Reload (↻)</kbd>, and follow the instructions to
        re-enable secure mode or developer mode, then powerwash.
      </p>
      <p>
        By this point, your Chromebook is unenrolled again and you have
        successfully taken a kiosk test!
