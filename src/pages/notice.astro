        <h1>What Happened?</h1>
            <font size="+1"
            ><p>
                On February 28th, 2025, my OneDrive had suddenly been taken down 
                because it was violating "<i>the Acceptable Use Policy located in 
                the Terms of Use.</i>"
              <br />
              <br />
                As unfortunate as this is, there isn't much I can do about it.
            </p></font

        <h2>Okay, What About The Files?</h2>
            <font size="+1"
            ><p>
                All of the files are currently inaccessible, meaning I cannot download,
                access, move, or do anything with them. This not only affects the files
                that are currently accessible on dl.darkn.bio, but also my own personal 
                files.
            <br />
            <br />
                Again, there isn't much I can do about it.

            <h2>Did You Appeal?</h2>
            <font size="+1"
            ><p>
                I have appealed, but as of March 3rd, 2025, the appeal has been <b>declined.</b>
            <br />
            <br />
                This means the host will <b>NOT</b> be coming back, and you'll have to use other hosts now. Sorry.
            </p></font

        <br />
            <h2>What Happens Now?</h2>
            <font size="+1"
            ><p>
                I leave. I move onto other endeavours and stop hosting, lol. If you want other
                hosts to use in the meantime, here:
