One day I was looking around a person's blog when I stumbled across one of
their posts named "[Breaking chromeOS's enrollment security model: A postmortem](https://blog.coolelectronics.me/breaking-cros-6/)". I was intrigued, but there were a few things that were 
wrong with their post which prompted me to create a post of my own with the 
correct fixes.

### As of Dec 27, 2023, their blog has fixed the incorrect listed pins.

## Bypassing Instructions
Please understand that **I DO NOT RECOMMEND DOING THIS.** It is risky, dangerous, and not easy to do
for beginners. Please attempt at your own risk. Any damages made is **your own fault. Not mine, or others.**

**Necessary Items:**
- **Conductive Material**: Staple, Tin Foil, Paperclip, etc.
- **Scissors**: $4 avg.
- **Tape**: $4 avg. **(Recommended, but optional)**

**Other Requirements:**
- USB or SD Card with [SH1MMER](https://sh1mmer.me)
- Screwdriver corresponding to your Chromebook screws
- Competence and courage, because I don't recommend this.

### Opening The Chromebook
First, you will need to open up your Chromebook using, most likely, a Phillips screwdriver. After that,
disconnect the battery on the Chromebook. Methods to disconnect the connector may vary on each model.

        width="440" 
    />
    <figcaption style="text-align: center">Examples of Battery Connector</figcaption>
</figure>

Afterword, look around the Chromebook motherboard and look for **a small 8-pin chip with pins sticking out or in.**
These chips tend to have **WINBOND** or **GIGADEVICE** branding, and may either say **25Q64[xx]** or **25Q128[xx]**
right below the branding. **You may need to flip over the motherboard to find this chip.**

Your Chromebook may have multiple of these chips, just look for the one that is most similar to the description
stated or most similar to the pictures provided below.

Please understand that the SOIC-8 chip, the one on the left or appears second, is much easier to bridge than the 
WSON-8 chip, the one on the right or appears first.

    />

        width="438" 
    />

### Bridging Pins
Now you're going to have to use the picture(s) below as reference on **what pins to bridge**, as this is important. These
are the charts for both of the chips:

<figure>
    <img 
        style="float: right" 
        src="../images/the-tsunami/wson-8-chart.png" 
        alt="WSON-8 chart" 
        width="440"
    />
    <img 
        src="../images/the-tsunami/soic-8-chart.png" 
        alt="SOIC-8 chart" 
        width="440" 
    />
    <figcaption style="text-align: center">SOIC-8 chart (left) - WSON-8 chart (right)</figcaption>
</figure>

**"How do you bridge these pins?"** This is where the supplies you got earlier comes into play, as they'll be
how you can bridge these pins.

Take a piece of your conductive material and shape it into something that's **long enough** to get to either side 
of the chip while being **small enough** to not make contact with multiple pins on either side of the chip. I 
cannot provide measurements as the chip size is different on each model.

Through using the charts listed above, look for the circle/indent on the chip so you can know where each pin is located.
From here, take your conductive material and place one end on **pin 3 (WP)** and place the other end on **pin 8 (VCC).** 
**MAKE SURE** it's making contact with the pins and **IS NOT** making contact with other nearby pins. You may place tape
on top of the chip to keep the conductive material on the pins, but that's if you have to.

Use the picture below to know where to put the tin foil and tape:
- **Green**: Indent / Circle
- **Red**: Conductive Material
- **Blue**: Tape

    />

### Booting Into SH1MMER
After the pins are **securely** bridged, you may plug in the charger (or the battery) alongside all the other necessary 
cables and boot the Chromebook. Once it has booted, boot into SH1MMER as you normally would. Disable OS verification 
(blocked or not), boot into the "Insert Recovery Media" screen, and plug in your SH1MMER USB or SD card.

Enter the Utilities screen and run "Un-Enroll Device" (or "Deprovision Device" if Legacy). This won't do anything 
currently,  but it's a necessary step. After that, enter the Bash Shell and then run the following commands. 
It should end up like the picture below:

```bash
flashrom --wp-disable
  /usr/share/vboot/bin/set_gbb_flags.sh 0x8090
```
**If the commands fails here, you need to repeat the [Bridging Pins](#bridging-pins) instructions.**

        alt="Command Output" 
    />
    <figcaption style="text-align: center">Command Output (Bash Shell)</figcaption>
</figure>

### Booting into ChromeOS
Reboot the Chromebook and get past the OS verification screen by pressing **CTRL + D**. After waiting 5 minutes and
booting into ChromeOS, **DO NOT PROCEED WITH THE SETUP SCREEN.** Instead, enter the VT2 shell by pressing 
**CTRL + ALT + F2**.

Log into the shell as **root** and then run the following commands. It should end up like the picture below:
```bash
tpm_manager_client take_ownership
  cryptohome --action=remove_firmware_management_parameters
```

<figure>
    <img 
        src="../images/the-tsunami/unpatch_shell_results.webp" 
        alt="Command Output" 
    />
    <figcaption style="text-align: center">Command Output (VT2 Shell)</figcaption>
</figure>

Both the commands should report success, and if they do, that's great! Simply exit out of the VT2 shell by pressing 
**CTRL + ALT + F1**, then powerwash the Chromebook by pressing **CTRL + ALT + SHIFT + R**. Once it's powerwashed, you 
may go through the setup screen and it shouldn't re-enroll anymore!

## Closing Thoughts
I don't know what to say except that **I extremely do not recommend doing this.** It's a difficult process for
new users that don't know how to bridge pins, and it's very easy to brick your Chromebook doing this.

There have already been reports of people bricking their Chromebook in servers like the [SH1MMER Discord](https://discord.gg/f7c3xySHuW) 
or the [TitaniumNetwork Discord](https://discord.gg/unblock). These are because of bridging incorrect pins, bridging multiple pins, 
or many other reasons.

***Note**: Some of these reports don't have any evidence, but it probably did happen.*

All in all, just don't do this shit. If your Chromebooks bricks, that's on you. But if you do this and your Chromebook
ends up being unenrolled, then congratulations. You took the risk for a huge reward, and now you can do whatever the hell
you want on that Chromebook.

For me, I have OCTOPUS and JACUZZI Chromebooks where I can downgrade to any version anytime I want and use SH1mmer 
cause I used [this guide](https://osu.bio/sh1mmer/unfog), so I don't need to do this.

**Not like I'd ever do this myself anyways.**
