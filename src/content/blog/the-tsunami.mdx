One day I was looking around a person's blog when I stumbled across one of
their posts named "[Breaking chromeOS's enrollment security model: A postmortem](https://blog.coolelectronics.me/breaking-cros-6/)". I was intrigued, but there were a few things that were 
wrong with their post which prompted me to create a post of my own with the 
correct fixes.

### As of Dec 27, 2023, their blog has fixed the incorrect listed pins.
***
## Providing Context
Originally when I was reading through the blog, it had mentioned about a ChromeOS
firmware patch in v114 which introduced a patch that the community named, "The Tsunami".

This patch was intended to prevent users from disabling 
[write protection](https://blog.coolelectronics.me/breaking-cros-6/#so-what-even-is-write-protection) 
if they had Firmware Management Parameters (FWMP) on their device, which was meant to
prevent users from unenrolling through disabling write protection.

Within this post, it mentioned about bypassing The Tsunami through using a **pencil**
(you can find this to be wrong later) to bridge pins 3 and 4 on the SOIC-8 chip inside of the 
Chromebook's motherboard.

    />

However, there was something wrong with these instructions. An unexperienced user wouldn't
be able to notice the underlying problems in these "instructions", but.. **you aren't supposed 
to bridge pins 3 and 4.**

This concerned me as providing incorrect instructions for something so dangerous can actually
cause a user to brick their Chromebook. *Yes, there are people in this community, many in fact,
who do this type of shit just to unenroll their device.*

I found the blog's source code on their GitHub and sent a [pull request](https://blog.coolelectronics.me/breaking-cros-6/) fixing the incorrect instructions issue (alongside some other issues), and the pull request 
was declined.

Understandably, sending a PR to a blog can piss off someone, but this is meant to fix serious 
issues in a blog post that is used widely within the community.

The reason that it was the "[pencil bypass](https://blog.coolelectronics.me/breaking-cros-6/#the-pencil-bypass)" 
to begin with and why it's still there now is because the creator thought it was "funny" and even 
though I won't deny that, it's still an issue.

Having incorrect info isn't the greatest, which I replied with in the PR, and it's especially an
issue when a blog post like this is widely used within the community as reference to new users.

I decided that I was gonna make my own blog with a post like the one you're reading right now 
that provides correct instructions, however I had gotten lazy and schoolwork was piling up, 
so I couldn't till now.

Anyways, that's enough context, here are the **proper** instructions for bypassing The Tsunami,
since [their blog post](https://blog.coolelectronics.me/breaking-cros-6/) still has some problems,
even since Jan 7th, 2023.

## Bypassing Instructions
Please understand that **I DO NOT RECOMMEND DOING THIS.** It is risky, dangerous, and not easy to do
for beginners. Please attempt at your own risk. Any damages made is **your own fault. Not mine, or others.**

**Necessary Items:**
- **Tin Foil**: $2 avg.
- **Scissors**: $4 avg.
- **Tape**: $4 avg. **(Optional)**

**Other Requirements:**
- USB or SD Card with SH1MMER
- Screwdriver corresponding to your Chromebook screws
- Competence and courage, because I don't recommend this.

### Opening The Chromebook
First, you will need to open up your Chromebook using, most likely, a Phillips screwdriver. After that,
disconnect the battery on the Chromebook. Methods to disconnect the connector may vary on each model.

    />

        width="440" 
    />
    <figcaption style="text-align: center">Examples of Battery Connector</figcaption>
</figure>

Afterword, look around the Chromebook motherboard and look for **a small 8-pin chip with pins sticking out or in.**
These chips tend to have **WINBOND** or **GIGADEVICE** branding, and may either say **25Q64[xx]** or **25Q128[xx]**
right below the branding. **You may need to flip over the motherboard to find this chip.**

Your Chromebook may have multiple of these chips, just look for the one that is most similar to the description
stated or most similar to the pictures provided below.

Please understand that the SOIC-8 chip, the one on the left or appears first, is much easier to bridge than the 
WSON-8 chip, the one on the right or appears second.

        width="438" 
    />
    <figcaption style="text-align: center">SOIC-8 chip (left) - WSON-8 chip (right)</figcaption>
</figure>

### Bridging Pins
Now you're going to have to use the picture(s) below as reference on **what pins to bridge**, as this is important. These
are the charts for both of the chips:

        alt="SOIC-8 chart" 
        width="440" 
    />
    <figcaption style="text-align: center">SOIC-8 chart (left) - WSON-8 chart (right)</figcaption>
</figure>

**"How do you bridge these pins?"** This is where the supplies you got earlier comes into play, as they'll be
how you can bridge these pins.

Take a piece of tin foil and cut it where it's **long enough** to get to either side of the chip while
being **small enough** to not make contact with multiple pins on either side of the chip. I cannot provide
measurements as the chip size is different on each model.

Through using the charts listed above, look for the circle/indent on the chip so you can know where each pin is located.
From here, use the tin foil and place one end on **pin 3 (WP)** and place the other end on **pin 8 (VCC).** 
**MAKE SURE** it's making contact with the pins and **IS NOT** making contact with other nearby pins. You may place tape
on top of the chip to keep the tin foil on the pins, but that's if you have to.

Use the picture below to know where to put the tin foil and tape:
- **Green**: Indent/Circle
- **Red**: Tin Foil
- **Blue**: Tape

        width="438" 
    />
    <figcaption style="text-align: center">SOIC-8 bridge (left) - WSON-8 bridge (right)</figcaption>
</figure>

### Booting Into SH1MMER
After the pins are **securely** bridged, you may plug in the charger (or the battery) alongside all the other necessary 
cables and boot the Chromebook. Once it has booted, boot into SH1MMER as you normally would. Disable OS verification 
(blocked or not), boot into the "Insert Recovery Media" screen, and plug in your SH1MMER USB or SD card.

Enter the Utilities screen and run "Un-Enroll Device" (or "Deprovision Device" if Legacy). This won't do anything currently, 
but it's a necessary step. After that, enter the Bash Shell and then run the following commands. It should end up like the
picture below:

```bash
flashrom --wp-disable
  /usr/share/vboot/bin/set_gbb_flags.sh 0x8090
```
**If the commands fails here, you need to repeat the [Bridging Pins](#bridging-pins) instructions.**

        alt="Command Output" 
    />
    <figcaption style="text-align: center">Command Output (Bash Shell)</figcaption>
</figure>

### Booting into ChromeOS
Reboot the Chromebook and get past the OS verification screen by pressing **CTRL + D**. After waiting 5 minutes and
booting into ChromeOS, **DO NOT PROCEED WITH THE SETUP SCREEN.** Instead, enter the VT2 shell by pressing 
**CTRL + ALT + F2**.

Log into the shell as **root** and then run the following commands. It should end up like the picture below:
```bash
tpm_manager_client take_ownership
  cryptohome --action=remove_firmware_management_parameters
```

<figure>
    <img 
        src="https://osu.bio/sh1mmer/assets/unpatch_shell_results.webp" 
        alt="Command Output" 
    />
    <figcaption style="text-align: center">Command Output (VT2 Shell)</figcaption>
</figure>

Both the commands should report success, and if they do, that's great! Simply exit out of the VT2 shell by pressing 
**CTRL + ALT + F1**, then powerwash the Chromebook by pressing **CTRL + ALT + SHIFT + R**. Once it's powerwashed, you 
may go through the setup screen and it shouldn't re-enroll anymore!

## Closing Thoughts
I don't know what to say except that **I extremely do not recommend doing this.** It's a difficult process for
new users that don't know how to bridge pins, and it's very easy to brick your Chromebook doing this.

There have already been reports of people bricking their Chromebook in servers like the [SH1MMER Discord](https://discord.gg/f7c3xySHuW) 
or the [TitaniumNetwork Discord](https://discord.gg/unblock). These are because of bridging incorrect pins, bridging multiple pins, 
or many other reasons.

***Note**: Some of these reports don't have any evidence, but it probably did happen.*

All in all, just don't do this shit. If your Chromebooks bricks, that's on you. But if you do this and your Chromebook
ends up being unenrolled, then congratulations. You took the risk for a huge reward, and now you can do whatever the hell
you want on that Chromebook.

For me, I have OCTOPUS and JACUZZI Chromebooks where I can downgrade to any version anytime I want and use SH1mmer 
cause I used [this guide](https://osu.bio/sh1mmer/unfog), so I don't need to do this.

**Not like I'd ever do this myself anyways.**
