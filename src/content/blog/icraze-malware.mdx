## iCraze: A Malware Distributor
iCraze was a well-known developer of iOS jailbreak tweaks. He was
known for his high-quality tweaks and his willingness to help other
developers. However, in 2023, it was revealed that iCraze had been
putting malware in his tweaks. The malware was designed to steal
users' personal information, such as their device information,
passwords, and location. iCraze was quickly exposed and banned from
the jailbreak acommunity.

The iCraze malware scandal was a major blow to the jailbreak
community. It showed that even trusted developers could be
compromised. As a result of the scandal, many users became more
cautious about installing tweaks from unknown sources.

The iCraze malware scandal also had a significant impact on the iOS
jailbreak scene. It led to a decline in the number of jailbreak
tweaks being developed and released. It also made it more difficult
for users to find safe and reliable jailbreak tweaks.

This should be a reminder to YOU that even the most trusted
developers can be compromised. It is important to be vigilant when
installing tweaks from unknown sources and to only install tweaks
from trusted developers or repositories. You should also remove any
repos or tweaks that have a warning in Sileo.
## Infected Tweaks
- [Nexus](https://havoc.app/package/nexus)

Nexus is an iOS 16-inspired lock screen customization tweak that is meant to surpass much worse tweaks such as [AIM](https://havoc.app/package/aim) and [AIM Pro](https://havoc.app/package/aimpro). However on March 14, 2023, iCraze created an update which was meant to be some small "fixes and changes". This included a piece of malware which infected every device who had updated to that version of Nexus at the time.

- [Hestia](https://havoc.app/package/hestia)

Hestia is a jailbreak detection bypasser, being similar to other tweaks such as A-Bypass and Shadow. However on December 10, 2022, iCraze published an update to the Hestia tweak on Havoc which was meant to fix a preference issue on [XinaA15](https://github.com/NotDarkn/XinaA15). This update happened to also include a piece of malware in the code which infected all devices running iOS 15.0 up to 15.1.1.

- [Custom Player](https://havoc.app/package/customplayer)

Custom Player is a tweak that allowed an end-user to easily modify their music player. On February 14, 2022, this was one of, if not the first tweak, to get injected with the "iCraze Malware" which made all devices that had Custom Player installed start to slow down. This slowdown would drastically get worse as the user kept using their phone by the minute, and after 10 minutes the device would go into a [bootloop](https://ios.cfw.guide/troubleshooting/#bootloops); permanently being bricked.
